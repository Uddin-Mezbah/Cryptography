Number theory, also known as 'higher arithmetic', 
is one of the oldest branches of mathematics and 
is used to study the properties of positive integers. 
It helps to study the relationship between different 
types of numbers such as prime numbers, rational numbers, 
and algebraic integers.
In the mid-20s, the number theory was considered as one of 
the purest forms of mathematics until digital computers proved 
that this theory can provide answers to real-world problems.
